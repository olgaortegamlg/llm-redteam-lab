# llm-redteam-lab

This repository contains my local lab for exploring large language model (LLM) red teaming techniques and bug hunting. It will serve as the environment for experimenting with prompts, jailbreaks, fuzzers and other AI security research.

## Stack

- **Docker** – containerize and manage services in a reproducible way.
- **Ollama** – run Llama 3 and other open LLMs locally for red‑teaming.
- **VS Code** – coding environment with extensions for Python, Docker and Markdown.
- **Python 3.11** – base language for scripts and fuzzers.
